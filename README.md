# hirearchical-mpc
An energy-optimal control system for off-grid solar irrigation. Features a Hierarchical Cyber-Physical Architecture that decouples biological optimization (Outer Loop MPC) from electromechanical stabilization (Inner Loop Adaptive PI), achieving 57% water savings and 58% energy efficiency compared to standard timers.
